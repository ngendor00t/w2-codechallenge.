This app is used to get votes of the cutest animal
it takes data of every animal and loops over each to get the votes 
while working on this app it was really difficult but manageable on the fetching part.

 ## Getting Started
to get the data you need to install Db.json for the backened,
after installation
you should create files
starting with index.html
                script.js
                style.css
                db.json
this files will help you in the creation of the app every file has its own need
index.html

in the first file index,html it helps create the structure of the app
on the html we will need to link script.js since our data will be there after fetching it from db.json
will be using external css 
so on the head where our metadata is located we will link css there 
```javascript


    !Doctypehtml
    <html 
    <head
    <link rel=stylesheet href.style.css>
    
    />
    <body
   <script src"script.js"/script>
    />


```
